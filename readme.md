Headline: Why use a spreadsheet when you can build a CRM? 💻🔧

I’ve finally pushed my latest project to GitHub: a Collaborative & Analytical CRM built entirely with Django.

Being an AIML Developer and Data Analyst, I’ve always been curious about how we can turn "messy data" into actual business growth. I decided to build a "Digital Brain" that tracks the whole journey—from the first handshake (Lead) to the final handshake (Deal).

What’s under the hood?

🏗 Custom UI: I wasn't feeling the default vertical layout, so I hacked the CSS with a custom Flexbox grid to make it look clean on widescreen monitors.

📈 Data-First Dashboards: Integrated Sales Funnels and Income Summaries so you actually know where your money is coming from.

🤝 Team Flow: Built-in internal chat and task assignments because nobody likes back-and-forth emails.

📧 Email Automation: It syncs correspondence automatically, keeping the history right where it belongs.

This was a great challenge for my final year MCA at Ramdeobaba University, and a huge shoutout to the SS Infotech team for the constant inspiration to build tools that scale.
